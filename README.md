# Institute_for_Biodiversity_Forecasting-
The main product of our proposed Institute for Biodiversity Forecasting is a series of forecasts that are both rigorously generated and practical for end-users in science and conservation. Forecasts will focus on three facets of change: (1) speciesâ€™ geographic distribution, (2) community structure, and (3) ecosystem function.
